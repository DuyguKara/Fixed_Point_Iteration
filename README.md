# Fixed_Point_Iteration
This web application provides an interface to perform fixed point iteration and present the results to the user.

## Overview

This web application implements the fixed-point iteration method to find roots of nonlinear equations. It provides a visual interface to experiment with different functions, initial guesses, tolerances, and see the iteration process graphically.

## Features

Visualization: Displays a plot of the function, iterations, and the root.
Interactive Form: Allows users to input parameters and submit requests.
JSON Response: Returns results as JSON for integration into other applications.
Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust the initial guess, tolerance, and maximum iterations.
Function Input: Users can enter their own function to find its roots.
